# Manual_Regression_OnlyNumpy
Linear Regression is a base fundamental concept in machine learning. Everything, no matter what has at some-point started with y=wx+b. 

Creating linear model with Scikit learn is a peace-of-cake. But manual implementation gives a clear understanding of under the hood implementations.
#
In this small implementation, I have used only Numpy, to manually build multivariable(two) linear-regression, with randomly generated data...
